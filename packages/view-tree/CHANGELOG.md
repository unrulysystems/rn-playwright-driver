## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/unrulysystems/rn-playwright-driver/pull/30) [`4bdbe20`](https://github.com/unrulysystems/rn-playwright-driver/commit/4bdbe2073f7b613f6bfb8d5a13db5e0ca000e1c5) Thanks [@alleneubank](https://github.com/alleneubank)! - Upgrade the dogfood example and native module tooling to Expo SDK 56.

  The driver now sends a React Native inspector-compatible WebSocket Origin when
  attaching to Hermes CDP, which keeps Expo SDK 56 dev-client debugging connected
  on localhost Metro servers. The runner also fast-fails companion readiness when
  captured iOS or Android companion logs contain terminal build, test, or
  instrumentation failure markers instead of waiting for the full probe timeout.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes
